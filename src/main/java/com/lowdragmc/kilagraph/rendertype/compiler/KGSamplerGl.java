/**
 * Maps a compiled sampler's {@link SamplerDefault} (KilaGraph's own filter/address enums) to the concrete
 * GL sampler-object parameters, and resolves which texture unit each managed sampler binds to.
 *
 * <p>1.20.1 has no per-draw {@code GpuSampler} (that is a 1.21.5+ concept), so the runtime instead binds a GL
 * {@code sampler object} ({@code glGenSamplers}/{@code glBindSampler}) to the sampler's texture unit — which
 * overrides the shared texture object's own filter/wrap for that unit only, giving per-material sampling
 * without mutating the texture. This class is the headless half of that: it only computes the int params and
 * unit indices (the {@code GL11}/{@code GL12} values are compile-time constants, folded to literals, so this
 * class carries no runtime GL dependency and stays usable on the dedicated-server / compiler layer). The
 * actual {@code glGenSamplers}/{@code glBindSampler} calls live in the client runtime
 * ({@code KGMaterialValues}).</p>
 *
 * <p>The texture unit for a sampler is its index in {@code ShaderInstance.getSamplerNames()} — because vanilla
 * {@code ShaderInstance.apply()} binds the sampler at index {@code j} to {@code GL_TEXTURE0 + j} (the name list
 * is compacted at link time, so index == unit).</p>
