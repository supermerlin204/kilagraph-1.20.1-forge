/**
 * Reading redstone.
 *
 * <h2>Read-only, deliberately</h2>
 * There is no "set the power here" node, because the game has no such operation: redstone power is not
 * stored at a position, it is <em>computed</em> from what the surrounding blocks emit. A graph that wants
 * to emit a signal places something that emits one — a redstone block, a lever, a repeater — with
 * {@code mc_set_block}, which is exactly what a player would do. A setter would have to lie.
 *
 * <h2>The four questions, which are genuinely different</h2>
 * Redstone has more than one notion of "powered" and picking the wrong one is the classic mistake:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Best neighbour signal</b> — the strongest signal reaching this block from any side. This is
 *       what a lamp uses, and what most graphs mean by "is it on".</li>
 *   <li><b>Signal from a side</b> — what one particular neighbour is providing, which is how a comparator
 *       reads its sides differently from its back.</li>
 *   <li><b>Direct signal</b> — strong power only, ignoring the weak power a block passes on after being
 *       energised. The difference is why a redstone dust next to a powered block lights up but a repeater
 *       facing it may not.</li>
 *   <li><b>Analog output</b> — a container's fullness as 0-15, which is what a comparator reads. Nothing
 *       to do with the signal reaching the block.</li>
 * </ul>
