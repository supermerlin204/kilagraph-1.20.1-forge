/**
 * Builds an {@link ItemStack} from an {@link Item} and a count.
 *
 * <h2>What this is for, and what it is not</h2>
 * <b>Runtime composition only.</b> To author a literal stack — a specific item, count and set of
 * components, picked in the editor — drop a plain {@code Item Stack} constant node instead: its
 * configurator edits all of that and serialises with the graph, which this node cannot do.
 *
 * <p>This node exists for the case a constant cannot cover: an item that is not known until the graph
 * runs. An item looked up from an id, chosen by a Select, or read off another stack, combined with a
 * count that was computed. Neither input can be baked in, so neither can be a constant.
 *
 * <p>Components are deliberately not inputs here. Adding them would be a second, worse way to do what
 * {@code Set Component} already does, and it would have to take them as one opaque blob rather than
 * one at a time. Build the stack here and pipe it through {@code Set Component} for each one.
