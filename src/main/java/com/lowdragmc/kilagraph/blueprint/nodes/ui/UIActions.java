/**
 * Shared rules for the {@code ldlib2_ui_*} nodes.
 *
 * <h2>Every mutating node reports {@code ok} and flows on</h2>
 * Same contract as {@link com.lowdragmc.kilagraph.blueprint.nodes.mc.action.McActions}, and for the
 * same reason: a UI graph runs on both sides, and half of what these nodes touch is client-only.
 * {@code layout()} and {@code style(Consumer)} are outright no-ops on the server (LDLib2 guards
 * them), a {@code ModularUI} may not exist yet while a tree is still being assembled, and an element
 * may simply not implement the interface a node needs. None of that is exceptional. A node that
 * threw would make the same graph crash on one side and work on the other, so instead each one
 * reports {@code ok = false} and continues; a graph that cares can branch on it.
 *
 * <h2>Which side does what</h2>
 * Structure — children, ids, classes, event listeners, sync values, RPC registration — behaves
 * identically on both sides, and has to: {@code UISyncManager} identifies sync values by their
 * <em>registration order</em>, so the client and the server must walk the same graph and register
 * the same things in the same sequence or the packets decode against the wrong values. Appearance is
 * client-only. {@code ldlib2_ui_side} exists so a graph can branch when it needs to, but the right
 * default is to build the same tree everywhere and let the guards drop what the server cannot use.

     * <h2>Why every UI constructor is an exec node</h2>
     * A node that makes a new {@code UIElement} is not a pure function of its inputs: the element has
     * identity. Two things break if it is treated as one.
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Event handlers would get a different element.</b> A dispatch clears the pull cache
     *       before re-entering the graph (it has to — see {@link com.lowdragmc.kilagraph.graph.ui.UICallbacks}),
     *       so a pure-data constructor would run again and hand the handler a <em>freshly built</em>
     *       button rather than the one the player just clicked. The graph would look right and do
     *       nothing.</li>
     *   <li><b>Loops would get the same element.</b> Memoising in node state to fix the first problem
     *       breaks the second: a {@code ForEach} building one row per item would produce one row and
     *       reuse it, because node state deliberately survives the per-iteration cache clear.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Being an exec node resolves both, because it makes "when is a new one made" an explicit part
     * of the graph rather than a consequence of when something happened to be pulled: the constructor
     * runs exactly when the flow reaches it — once during a build, once per iteration inside a loop —
     * and {@link #republish} serves that same instance to every later pull.</p>
     *
     * <p>Nodes that only <em>look something up</em> stay pure data: a stylesheet fetched from
     * {@code StylesheetManager} or a template from the resource library is the same shared instance
     * every time, so re-pulling it is free and cannot surprise anyone.</p>
