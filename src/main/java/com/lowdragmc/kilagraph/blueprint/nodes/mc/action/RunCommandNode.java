/**
 * Runs a Minecraft command.
 *
 * <h2>Why this node exists at all</h2>
 * It is the escape hatch. This mod has a few hundred nodes and the game has more verbs than that — a
 * command covers whatever has no node yet, and covers it with syntax users already know. A scripting
 * layer without one forces every gap to wait for a new node.
 *
 * <h2>Permission level 2, like a command block</h2>
 * Not 4. Level 2 is what a command block runs at, which makes this node's reach exactly the reach of a
 * contraption a player could already build: {@code summon}, {@code setblock}, {@code tp} and most of the
 * useful set work, while {@code op}, {@code stop} and {@code ban} do not. Level 4 would mean any graph
 * anyone imports can take over the server, and the permission is not exposed as an input because a port
 * that escalates privileges is a port someone will wire to a constant without reading this paragraph.
 *
 * <h2>Feedback is captured, not broadcast</h2>
 * A command run from a graph should not spam chat, and its output is often the reason for running it —
 * {@code data get} and {@code scoreboard players get} answer through their feedback text. So the source
 * collects messages instead of forwarding them, and hands them back on {@code output}. Nothing reaches
 * chat and the {@code sendCommandFeedback} gamerule is not involved.
 *
 * <h2>What the command sees as "here" and "me"</h2>
 * Relative coordinates and selectors need an origin. Given an {@code entity}, that entity is the executor
 * — {@code @s} resolves to it, {@code ~ ~ ~} is its position, and its rotation orients {@code ^ ^ ^}.
 * Given only a {@code pos}, the position is that block's centre with no executor, so {@code @s} matches
 * nothing. This is the same distinction as {@code /execute as} versus {@code /execute positioned}.
