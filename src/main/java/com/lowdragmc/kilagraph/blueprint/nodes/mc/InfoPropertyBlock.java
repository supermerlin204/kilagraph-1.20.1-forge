/**
 * Base for a block that reads one property of its parent {@link InfoContextNode}'s target.
 *
 * <p>A subclass declares its outputs as annotated fields and implements {@link #read}; everything else —
 * finding the parent, pulling its {@code target} through the executor, and the null/wrong-type case —
 * happens here. That is what keeps a property down to about ten lines, which is what makes one class per
 * property affordable.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * @NodeAttribute(name = "mc_level_rain_level", group = "mc/world", graphTypes = BlueprintGraph.class)
 * @UseWithContext(LevelInfoNode.class)
 * public static class RainLevel extends InfoPropertyBlock<Level> {
 *     @OutputPort public float value;
 *
 *     @Override protected Class<Level> targetClass() { return Level.class; }
 *
 *     @Override protected void read(Level level, EvalContext ctx) {
 *         ctx.setOutput("value", level.getRainLevel(1.0f));
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Missing target</h2>
 * When the parent's target is absent — nothing wired in, or a subgraph that has not been given one yet —
 * {@link #read} is not called and every output goes unstaged, which the executor publishes as null. A
 * consumer then sees its own declared default. The alternative, throwing, would make an unwired context
 * break the whole evaluation rather than the branch that depended on it; a property read is exactly the
 * kind of thing a half-built graph should tolerate.
 *
 * <p>The type check on top of that is defence in depth rather than the mechanism. LDLib2 enforces
 * {@code @UseWithContext} when a block is inserted — attaching a {@code Player} block to an
 * {@code Entity} context throws there, so a mismatched pair cannot be built. What the check does cover is
 * a target whose runtime type is narrower than the port's: a {@code Player}-scoped block is safe because
 * its context's {@code target} port is typed {@code Player}, and this makes that safety explicit instead
 * of relying on it.
 *
 * @param <T> the target type this block knows how to read
