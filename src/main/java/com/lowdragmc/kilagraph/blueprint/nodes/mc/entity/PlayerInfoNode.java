 * Holds a {@link Player} for the blocks in {@link PlayerInfoBlocks} to read — hunger, experience, held
 * items, game mode, posture.
 *
 * <p>It also accepts every block from {@link EntityInfoBlocks}, because a player is an entity and those
 * blocks are scoped to both contexts. So this is the entity context plus the player-only properties, and
 * a graph never has to choose between them.
 *
 * <p>{@code mc_entity_as_player} is how an {@code Entity} becomes a {@code Player} to feed this.
