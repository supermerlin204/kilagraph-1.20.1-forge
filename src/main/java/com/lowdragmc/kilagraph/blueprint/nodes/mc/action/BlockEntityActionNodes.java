/**
 * Writing to a block entity. See {@link McActions} for the rules every action shares.
 *
 * <h2>Three steps, and skipping any of them is a bug</h2>
 * Loading NBT into a block entity is the easy part. What makes the change actually take effect is what
 * comes after:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@code loadCustomOnly} applies the data;</li>
 *   <li>{@code setChanged} marks the chunk dirty, without which the change is lost on world save;</li>
 *   <li>{@code sendBlockUpdated} tells clients, without which the server and the screen disagree until
 *       something else happens to resend the block.</li>
 * </ol>
 * A node that did only the first would look correct in a single-player test and be wrong in every real
 * use. {@code McActionGameTest} asserts the value survives a re-read for exactly this reason.

     * <h2>This is the escape hatch, not the front door</h2>
     * It writes whatever the tag says, with no validation: a malformed tag produces a broken block entity
     * rather than an error, because the game's own loaders are lenient by design. Read the current data
     * with {@code mc_nbt_block_entity} first, change the one key you mean to change, and write it back —
     * writing a tag built from nothing will drop every field you did not include.
     *
     * <p>For inventories specifically, prefer the {@code mc_container_*} nodes: they go through the
     * capability, work on modded blocks, and cannot corrupt anything.
