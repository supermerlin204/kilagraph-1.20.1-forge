/**
 * The nearest generated structure of a given kind, as a position.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a node when /locate exists</h2>
 * {@code /locate} answers in chat. {@code mc_run_command} would hand the graph that sentence and leave it
 * to pull three numbers back out of prose that is translated per language. This returns the position.
 *
 * <h2>This one is expensive, and unusually so</h2>
 * The search walks candidate chunk positions outward and asks the world generator about each — the same
 * work {@code /locate} does, on the server thread, and a wide radius on a slow generator is measured in
 * seconds. Nothing else in this mod costs anything like it. Call it in response to something a player did,
 * not on a tick, and keep the radius small when the structure is common.
 *
 * <p>{@code radius} is in chunks, not blocks, matching the command. It is capped rather than trusted: a
 * radius wired from a runaway counter would otherwise search the world.
 *
 * <p>Existing chunks are not skipped, so a structure that has already generated nearby is found rather than
 * passed over — the same choice {@code /locate} makes, and the much cheaper one, since skipping requires
 * loading each candidate chunk to look at it.
 *
 * <p>Server side only, and false when the world was generated with structures turned off.
