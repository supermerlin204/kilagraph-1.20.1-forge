/**
 * A graph resolved once, up front, so that running it does not have to re-derive anything.
 *
 * <p>The old executor answered every question against the editor's live model on each step: which
 * port has this id (hash lookup), is it connected ({@code new ArrayList} + {@code new PortKey}),
 * which port feeds it (another {@code ArrayList} + {@code PortKey}), what kind of node is this
 * (a chain of {@code instanceof}). None of those answers change while a graph is being run, so all
 * of them are computed here instead — once per graph model, shared by every executor over it.</p>
 *
 * <p>What a run gets in exchange:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>every port owns an <b>integer slot</b>, so values live in a flat {@code Object[]} instead of
 *       an {@code IdentityHashMap};</li>
 *   <li>every input knows the slot it pulls from, or the fact that it reads an embedded constant —
 *       LDLib2's wire index is never consulted at run time;</li>
 *   <li>every exec output knows its downstream nodes as a plain array;</li>
 *   <li>every node's kind is a {@code switch} tag rather than an {@code instanceof} chain.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Nodes are not asked to do anything.</b> Port ids stay strings and {@code getInput} keeps its
 * signature; the id is resolved against a small per-node snapshot instead of the live model. That is
 * the whole point — every node benefits without its author knowing this class exists.</p>
 *
 * <p>What is deliberately <em>not</em> precomputed: when and how often a node runs. Nodes pull their
 * inputs lazily and that is observable — {@code And}/{@code Or} short-circuit, {@code Select} pulls
 * only the taken branch, {@code Cache} pulls once ever, {@code Random} draws from a shared RNG. So
 * preparation changes addressing only, never evaluation order or count.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Staleness</h2>
 * A prepared graph describes a topology, and editing the graph invalidates it. LDLib2 offers nothing
 * to hang that on: {@code GraphModel} has no version counter, {@code setGraphObjectDirty()} is an
 * empty stub, {@code PortWireIndex.isDirty} is private, and {@code GraphChangeDescription} is
 * accumulate-and-flush — the editor drains it every frame, so a second reader cannot use it. So this
 * class carries its own detection: a structural snapshot ({@link #snapshotStructure()}) of the wire
 * list, every wire's two endpoints, and every known node's port counts, re-compared by reference.
 *
 * <p>It is verified on every top-level entry into the executor, not per node — see
 * {@link GraphExecutor}. That covers rewiring (wire objects are new objects), node add/remove, and
 * the port-set changes an option edit causes via {@code defineNode()}. A same-count <em>rename</em>
 * would slip through, which is why id lookups fall back to the live model rather than failing; the
 * cost of a stale snapshot is a slow path, not a wrong answer. {@link #invalidate} is the explicit
 * hook for anything else.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 * By default a {@code PreparedGraph} is <b>not</b> thread-safe: it grows when a node is discovered
 * late ({@link #node} → {@link #admit}), which appends to {@link #nodes}, puts into the
 * {@code IdentityHashMap} {@link #byModel}, bumps {@link #slotCount}, re-derives {@link #mayCycle}
 * and re-takes the structural digest. A reader racing that sees a half-updated map.
 *
 * <p>{@link #seal()} is the way to share one instance across threads. A sealed graph never admits:
 * {@code node()} answers null for a model it does not already know and records {@link #sealBreached()}
 * instead, so the failure mode is a null — which every caller already handles — plus a flag, rather
 * than a data race. Nothing else here is written after {@code build()}: the per-node intrinsic
 * binding happens inside {@code link()}, and {@code seal()} forces the one lazy field
 * ({@link #variableWriters}) before it flips.
 *
 * <p><b>The sequence, and why each step is needed:</b></p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Run each graph once on one thread, and create every executor that will share it there too.
 *       {@code build()} discovers nodes from {@code getNodeModels()}, context blocks and both ends of
 *       every wire, but an orphan-spawned node with no wires reaches none of those — the warm-up is
 *       what proves the node set is complete. {@link #admitCount()} says whether it had to admit
 *       anything; a graph that admitted during warm-up is one whose shape {@code build()} could not
 *       see, and sealing it is a bet. The warm-up is also what makes the instance <em>shared</em>:
 *       {@link #of} reads {@link #CACHE} and populates it as two separate steps, so two threads
 *       meeting a graph for the first time at once can each build their own and then disagree about
 *       which one is canonical — sealing cannot help with that, only ordering can.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #seal()}, then submit the tasks. The reader threads' happens-before comes from the
 *       submission itself — every {@code ExecutorService} and {@code ForkJoinPool} establishes it —
 *       so sealing must complete <em>before</em> the fork, not during it.</li>
 *   <li>Every executor sharing the instance must be {@code setGraphFrozen(true)}. An unfrozen one
 *       re-checks freshness on entry and may replace the whole prepared graph mid-flight. Child
 *       executors inherit both halves of this: {@code GraphExecutor.checkoutChild} copies the frozen
 *       flag down the call tree, and {@code seal()} follows the subgraph call sites so a callee's
 *       prepared graph — shared between siblings exactly as its caller's is — is sealed too.</li>
 *   <li>After the join, check {@link #sealBreached()}. If it is set, some node was not in the
 *       prepared set and that run's results are not trustworthy — {@link #unseal()} and redo it
 *       serially. <b>Unsealing is not optional in that path</b>: a sealed graph keeps answering null
 *       on the serial retry too. {@code seal()}/{@code unseal()} are paired and counted, so a shared
 *       function graph stays sealed until every asset that sealed it has released it.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>One precondition is worth stating because it is not obvious: the sealed tree is collected from
 * <em>resolved</em> call sites ({@code Node.subInner}), which is what {@code GraphExecutor} uses to
 * make a child executor on its normal path — with {@code Opt.SUBGRAPH_PRERESOLVE} off it instead
 * resolves the callee live on entry, and could reach a graph the seal never saw. That switch exists
 * to be benchmarked against, not to be shipped, but the guarantee here is conditional on it.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #CACHE} map is synchronized independently of all this, and a frozen executor stops
 * consulting it after its first run ({@code GraphExecutor.syncPrepared}).</p>
