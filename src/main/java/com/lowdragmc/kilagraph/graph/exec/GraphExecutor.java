/**
 * Pull-based evaluator for a {@link Graph}. Demand-driven: callers request the value of an
 * {@link PortModel} (output port), and the executor recursively resolves upstream nodes,
 * memoising results for the lifetime of this executor instance.
 *
 * <p>Three "kick-off" surfaces:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #evaluate(PortModel, Class)} — pull a single output port.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #runOutputs()} — evaluate every {@code OUTPUT}-kind graph variable. The current
 *       convention: a graph variable is considered "written" when an {@link IVariableNode} for it
 *       has an INPUT-side port (the "set" form) with a connected wire. The executor pulls that
 *       wire to populate the result map. Unwritten OUTPUT variables fall back to their declared
 *       default (or to the env's variable store, if preloaded).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #executeFrom(NodeModel)} — run an exec-flow graph to completion.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Subgraphs ({@link SubgraphNodeModel}) get a transparent child executor: outer-input ports
 * mirror inner {@code READ} variables (parent feeds value in), outer-output ports mirror inner
 * {@code WRITE} variables (parent reads value out). Port ids are the inner variable's UUID
 * (with {@code -in}/{@code -out} suffixes for {@code READ_WRITE} variables).</p>
 *
 * <p>Not thread-safe; create a fresh executor per logical evaluation, or guard externally.</p>
 *
 * <h2>How a run is addressed</h2>
 * Everything structural is resolved once by {@link PreparedGraph} and shared across executors of the
 * same graph: which port an id names, which port feeds an input, which nodes an exec pin flows to,
 * what kind of node this is. A run therefore touches only integer-indexed arrays owned by this
 * executor — no map lookups against the editor model, and, after the first run has grown them, no
 * allocation at all:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>values live in {@link #slots}, one entry per port, validated by a {@link #generation}
 *       counter in {@link #stamps} — so {@link #clearCache()} costs what the run wrote rather than
 *       the size of the table, and "cached null" stays distinguishable from "not cached" the way
 *       {@code containsKey} did;</li>
 *   <li>{@link EvalContext}/{@link ExecContext} come from a depth-indexed pool, because pulling is
 *       re-entrant: a node's {@code evaluate} pulls upstream nodes from inside its own call;</li>
 *   <li>cycle detection is a {@code boolean[]} over node indices instead of a {@code LinkedHashSet}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * None of this is visible to nodes — {@code getInput(String, Class, T)} means exactly what it did.
