/**
 * One {@link PreparedGraph}, several threads, no admission.
 *
 * <h2>What is actually being pinned</h2>
 * A prepared graph is shared by every executor over the same graph model, and it used to <em>grow</em>
 * during execution: a node the build pass never reached was admitted on first sight, which appends to
 * an {@code ArrayList}, puts into an {@code IdentityHashMap} and re-derives the cycle flag. A second
 * thread reading that map while it rehashes does not get an exception, it gets a wrong answer or a
 * spin. {@link PreparedGraph#seal()} removes the write rather than guarding it — a sealed graph
 * answers null for an unknown node and raises {@link PreparedGraph#sealBreached()}, so the outcome is
 * one the caller can detect instead of one it cannot.
 *
 * <p>The concurrent test below cannot <em>prove</em> the absence of a race — no test can. It is here
 * because it does catch the admitting version, which was checked rather than assumed: with the seal
 * guard removed and every thread given its own orphan node to admit, it failed. <b>It failed on
 * {@link PreparedGraph#admitCount()}, not on a wrong value</b> — eight threads mutated the shared
 * {@code IdentityHashMap} and every computed result still came back correct that run. So the counter
 * is not a redundant extra assertion next to the value check; it is the one with detection power, and
 * the value check is the one that happens to be quiet. Do not delete it as noise.</p>
