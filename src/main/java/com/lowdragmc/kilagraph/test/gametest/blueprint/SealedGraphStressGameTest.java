/**
 * Many threads, one sealed {@link PreparedGraph} per asset, across every graph shape in the fixtures.
 *
 * <h2>What this adds over {@code SealedGraphConcurrencyGameTest}</h2>
 * That one proves the seal refuses admission, on one shape. This one asks whether concurrent
 * execution is actually <em>usable</em>: whether every kind of graph the library can build agrees
 * with its own serial answer under load, and whether it goes faster at all.
 *
 * <p>The shapes are not decoration. Each exercises a different piece of shared state:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the chains — the recursive data pull and the value-slot table;</li>
 *   <li>{@code locomotion}, {@code branch-ladder} — the exec VM and its frame stack;</li>
 *   <li>{@code accumulating-loop}, {@code variable-ping-pong} — loop controllers and the variable
 *       store, which must be per-executor or every thread scribbles on every other;</li>
 *   <li><b>{@code subgraph-calls}</b> — the one that matters most. A call runs on a <em>child</em>
 *       executor over the callee's own prepared graph, shared between siblings exactly as the outer
 *       one is. It is what proves {@code seal()} covers the call tree and not just the graph the host
 *       happens to be holding;</li>
 *   <li>{@code mixed-workload} — all of it at once, and the shape the scaling number is taken on.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Every executor gets the <em>same seed</em>, so a graph containing {@code Random} still has one
 * right answer and the comparison stays exact rather than approximate.</p>
