/**
 * What a context block costs the graph around it.
 *
 * <h2>What used to be here, and why it is gone</h2>
 * This file measured a property read two ways — a standalone node against the same property as a block
 * inside a context. Those shapes needed a duplicate node to compare against, and the seven duplicate
 * {@code mc_entity_*} nodes were deleted once the context form was settled on, so the comparison has no
 * second side left. Its results are in {@code docs/bench-baseline.md}: <b>34 vs 83 ns</b> for one
 * property, and <b>187 vs 255 ns</b> for four — the context costs about 30 ns per read and, contrary to
 * the prediction made before measuring, does <em>not</em> amortise across properties, because the cost is
 * reaching the parent's {@code target} rather than resolving it.
 *
 * <p>Two earlier findings from the reflective {@code info_field} era are recorded there too, both easy to
 * get wrong again: {@code Method.invoke} on a warm monomorphic call site is within <b>1.6 ns</b> of a
 * direct call, so reflection was never the cost; and a boxing benchmark on a small {@code int} measures
 * {@code Integer.valueOf}'s −128..127 cache rather than boxing.
 *
 * <p>As everywhere in this suite, timing is logged and never asserted — the assertions are on the values.

    /**
     * What one context block costs the rest of the graph.
     *
     * <p>The block is left <b>unconnected</b> on purpose: it takes no part in the chain being measured, so
     * any difference is the structural cost of its mere presence rather than the cost of reading it.
     * {@code PreparedGraph.detectCycle} gives up static cycle detection for any graph containing a block
     * node, so every node keeps paying the visiting-stack bookkeeping.
     *
     * <p>This has never been measurable: −3 ns on a 16-node chain, then +11, −118 and −156 on 64-node
     * ones, every one sign-unstable. <b>The chain length is the argument</b> — a genuine per-node cost
     * would have grown roughly fourfold from 16 to 64 nodes and did not. Kept because it was once cited as
     * a design justification before anyone measured it.</p>
