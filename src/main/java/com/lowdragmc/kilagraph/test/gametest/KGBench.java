 * it must run under {@code runGameTestServer} (no display, no client) because the real-client
 * bench occasionally dies on {@code glfwGetPrimaryMonitor failed} and takes minutes.
 *
 * <p><b>It never asserts wall-clock time.</b> Timing assertions are flaky on a busy machine and
 * meaningless on a fast one. The GameTests that use this assert only that the graph really
 * computed something; the numbers are <em>logged</em> for a human to compare before/after.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two quantities are reported, and the second is the one that matters for this work:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>ns/run</b> and <b>ns/node-step</b> — the portable cost measure. Absolute milliseconds
 *       are machine-specific; cost per node-step and the before/after ratio are not.</li>
 *   <li><b>bytes allocated per run</b> — measured with {@code ThreadMXBean.getThreadAllocatedBytes}.
 *       "Zero heap allocation per run" is the actual goal, so this is the primary number.</li>
